# Application for maintaining a news feed - IT DIGEST âš¡
The application is quite simple, but the most functional in the area of working with content and search.
A functionality for displaying articles, commenting and recommending articles by e-mail has been implemented.
The application was originally developed on a standard sqlite database, and further migrations were made to the Postgresql server to use full-text search.

### Last updates:
* Added article view counter, it increases by 1 every time the page is loaded. Redis was used.

### The ERD database diagram looks like this:
